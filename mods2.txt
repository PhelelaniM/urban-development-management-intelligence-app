The reset button must not only reset the GPS view but also the selected layers in the below dropdown.

The app must allow me to select layers and unselect the layers an d the map must be reactive once I un-select a layer in the Data Theme dropdown.When I change the selected layer to another one the map must react and change the layer viewed in the leaflet map.

Incorporate an attribute table that shows a table on the attributes of the data currently in view. Make this table small and dockable and minimizable . The table must have a refresh button that everytime I click refresh the view of the table updates to what data is visible in the leaflet map.
